# AUR Helpers

From Arch Wiki:

> AUR helpers automate usage of the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/). In particular, they may automate the following tasks:
> 
> - searching for packages published on the AUR;
> - resolving of dependencies between AUR packages;
> - retrieve and build AUR packages;
> - retrieve web content, such as user comments;
> - submission of AUR packages.

This section tries to cover all these helpers, divided according to their functionality.
